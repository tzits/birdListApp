A Currently Undeployed App for Birdwatching Enthusiasts. 
Sends Calls to eBird (Cornell Lab of Ornithology) to look up recent sightings of birds in the area or allows you to search a certain area for recent bird sightings

It also allows individuals to keep a private list of birds they've seen via a sqlite database on their ios device. (This info cannot be posted to eBird as the API does not allow for POST requests)
